## Description
**Context:** In this project, I have built a web application to store and manage your budget. 
The main goal was to developp a functionning back-end server, I've added some front-end for the user to be able to manipulate the data.
While the back is working, I am still working on the front to give more command to the user.

## Project Objectives

 - Build an API using Node.js and Express
 - Be able to create, read, update, and delete envelopes
 - Create endpoint(s) to update envelope balances
 - Use Git version control to keep track of your work
 - Use Postman to test API endpoints
 - Writing tests with Supertest 

## Technology
Project is created with:
 - ES6 Javascript
 - Node.js
 - Express.js
 - HTML
 - CSS
 
## Launch
Download the files and extract them in a file.
To run the server, be sure to have node installed: 
```
node server.js
```
And visit **localhost:3000** in your browser to interact with the front-end.

## How to use
You can get all the enveloppes from the home page.
You are also able to create a new enveloppe with a specific amount.
I am working on pages where it will be possible to update enveloppe, transfer some amount between existing enveloppes and delete enveloppe.
